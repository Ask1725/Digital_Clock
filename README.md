# Digital Clock Using Counters
This project demonstrates the implementation of a digital clock using counters, decoders, and seven-segment displays. The clock displays time in hours, minutes, and seconds using a 1Hz clock signal derived from a 555 timer.

## Components
- 555 Timer
- Decade Counter (IC 7490)
- Decoder (IC 7447)
- Seven-Segment Display
- DIP Switch
- Magnitude Comparator

## Circuit Diagram
The digital clock circuit was designed using counters and decoders to handle seconds, minutes, and hours, with AM/PM indication. The simulation of the circuit is carried out, and the schematic is available in the `images/` folder.

## Documentation
The detailed project report and circuit diagrams are available in the `docs/` folder.
